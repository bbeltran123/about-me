# About Me

I grew up in Northern California in a tiny town called Nevada City (for context, we have one traffic light in the entire town). Growing up close to Lake Tahoe, I spent a lot of time hiking and in the outdoors. I played a lot of different sports in high school like Tennis, Volleyball, Soccer (futbol), and Basketball. The sports I definitely enjoyed playing the most were soccer and volleyball. 

I love playing team sports and still try to play as much beach volleyball as I can and I'm also a big fan of eating in general. Whenever I plan trips to new places, I plan around what I'm going to eat.

I'm always down to talk about food/sports and I've also watched a lot of TV/movies. 

# Working Philosophy
Work is an avenue for exploring and building one's skills and interests. It should be an exercise in exploring one's passions and I firmly believe it should not be the dictator of one's self-worth. 

I love working with people who are passionate about change and self-growth and who like to solve and find interesting problems. As someone who has struggled with a fixed mindset and imposter syndrome, I know that I want to work with people who embrace failure and have grace with themselves and others. 

Personally, I measure success differently based off of my role and my goals but I want to always be a positive force that elevates others into leaders and changemakers.
